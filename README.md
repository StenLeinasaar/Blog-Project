# Goal of the project

The goal of the project was to practice connecting a basci frontend with a elementary backend. For backend I used ExpressJS and mongoDB. 

Practice allowed me to go over all steps included when it comes to hosting a website. I used AWS E2 engine to host my blog. 

## Plans for the future

I will build upon this project to add more robust backend structures and endpoints to interact with the database. Even to include cyber security main principles and best practices. Like parameterized queries. 


# THe structure of the project. 

### blog project backend folder

This contains the information about connecting to the database and servers. 

### src folder

Has main components of the blog. There are folders for pages, components, and assets. Organization still needs some work. The cleanup of the project will come later once I have finished with it.
